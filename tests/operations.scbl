# I made functions for the two simplest operations; addition and subtraction.
# The function for addition is add and it takes in two 64bit integers as parameters.
# The result is put into the variable result.
add 24:8 8:8 # 8 bytes = 64 bits
print result

# Subtraction function works the same, the name is sub
sub result 16:8

print result
# The output doesnt show anything, just blank lines. This is because the function print
# attempts to output it by the ascii encoding, in which the character with the ID 16 is
# some control character.
