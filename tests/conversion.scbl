# To solve the problem from operations.scbl, the integer needs to be converted into a string.
# For this theres a function called tostr which takes in an integer of any size and puts the
# result into the variable result.
tostr 32
print result

# The output is 32

add 24:8 8:8
sub result 16:8
tostr result
print result

# Success
# If you stored an integer that is not 64bits large and want to use it in the add or sub
# functions, you need to convert it to 64bits. For this theres the function to64b which,
# just like tostr, takes in an integer of any size and puts the result into the variable
# result.
var "int" 5
to64b int
add result 5:8
tostr result
print result
