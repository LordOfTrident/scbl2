# Since constants can be modified at runtime (from the C++ side), you can create a simple
# variable system. I made the function var which takes in a string, which is the variable
# name, and then the value, which can be anything.
var "test" 65
print test

var "test" 65 66 67 68 69 70
print test

var "test" "ABC"
